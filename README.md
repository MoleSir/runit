# runit

`runit` is a Rust library for physical units and quantities with compile-time safety and automatic unit conversions.

- [x] Supports SI units and common derived units  
- [x] Strongly typed unit-safe arithmetic  
- [x] Convenient macros for constructing quantities, e.g. `u!(10. mV)`  
- [x] Built-in physical formulas and unit relations, e.g. Ohm's law, power, energy  



## Example

```rust
use runit::u;

fn main() {
    let voltage = u!(5.0 V);
    let resistance = u!(10. Ω);
    let current = voltage / resistance; // Automatically inferred as Current
    println!("Current = {}", current); // prints: Current = 0.5A
}
```



## Supported Units

You can create quantities with the `u!` macro using units below (including common prefixes):

## Physical Formulas Implemented

The library supports unit-safe versions of common physical relations, for example:

- Ohm's Law:
     $$
     V = I \times R
     $$
     
- Power:
     $$
     P = V \times I
     $$
     
- Energy from power and time:
     $$
     E = P \times t
     $$
     
- Charge from capacitance and voltage:
     $$
     Q = C \times V
     $$
     
- Current from charge and time:
     $$
     I = \frac{Q}{t}
     $$
     
- Power from force and velocity:
     $$
     P = F \times v
     $$
     
- Energy from force and distance:
     $$
     E = F \times d
     $$
     
- Pressure from force and area:
     $$
     P = \frac{F}{A}
     $$
     
- Magnetic flux from flux density and area:
     $$
     \Phi = B \times A
     $$
     
- Voltage from magnetic flux and time:
     $$
     V = \frac{\Phi}{t}
     $$
